The TodAndLorna.com My First Cookie Cutter Template

A generic project template for python-backed web dev the TnL way!  Tod Hansmann wrote this for his use because this is how he works, but if you like it, great!

This should give you everything you need to access a database with a JSON API you can login against and get a token for.  Default login is siteadmin:ChangeMe! with the exclamation point in there.

You should start by going into the static directory and doing an `npm install` and `npm build`, followed by putting the SQL file into your postgres database of choice, and running the server via `COMMAND TO RUN SERVER HERE`

Yay!
