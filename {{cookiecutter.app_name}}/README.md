This should give you everything you need to access a database with a JSON API you can login against and get a token for.  Default login is siteadmin:ChangeMe! with the exclamation point in there.

You should start by going into the static directory and doing an `npm install` and `npm build`, followed by putting the SQL file into your postgres database of choice, and running the server via `COMMAND TO RUN SERVER HERE`

Yay!
